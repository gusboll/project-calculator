    <!-- title on the page saying 'calculator'
     give two options of calculator
        normal
        inverse
    div for the calculator layout
    input for the user
    inside it, room for the options like
    7 8 9 CE(backspace) C(clear)
    4 5 6 / * 
    1 2 3 - +
     0  . = +

    function operate that takes an operator and two numbers and then calls the answer for the operator and those numbers
     
    extras
        numbers and . should be a color
        every other function like / * - + = should be different colors from one another
        maybe display the result without the user touching the =?
